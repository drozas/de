A mountain is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain in a limited area, with having a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill, but

land mass is mountainous. 10% of people live in mountainous regions. Most of the world's rivers are fed from mountain sources, and more than half of 
humanity depends on mountains for water.
